tsMuxer broken on Linux
Videos with FLAC audio tracks are now muxable to LPCM, along with DTS
Videos paused due to seeking bug

- New features:
Lossless 5.1 PCM transcoding with DTS movies (Disabled by default, check the previous paragraph first)
Customizable AviSynth script

tsMuxer now working on Linux for basic muxing (don't forget to give it execution rights)
Web video streamdump engine (Useful for streams natively supported by ps3, such as mpeg on rtsp)
Maximum bitrate management
Small things: Runnable in console mode under Linux ("PMS.sh console"), Folder prioritization of a specific streaming/transcoding engine, Custom cover art, additional infos on thumbnails

- Fixes:
Potential network problem with Java/Vista + increase of packet ttl
