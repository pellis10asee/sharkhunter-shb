			<p>Usage in XMB</p>
			<p>Read plot: enter virtual folder #-- movie-info --# in XMB &gt;
				movie title &gt; IMDB INFO</p>
			<p>Watch trailers (English): enter virtual folder #-- movie-info

				&gt; [HD] movie title trailer or [SD] movie title trailer</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>I receive the error message &quot;No images&quot;, &quot;No
			tracks&quot;, or &quot;No titles&quot; when trying to view a folder
			that does contain valid media.</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution 1:</strong> You are in the wrong section of the <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar">XMB</a>. You have
				to be in "Photos" to view pictures, in "Music" to listen to music
				and in "Video" to watch videos. For example "Photos &gt; Web videos"
				will be empty, but "Video &gt; Web videos" will show files.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution 2:</strong> You have hit the folder-depth limit (8
				folders) and cannot browse any further in the folder tree. You have
				to share a different folder that is within the folder limit to the
				media you're trying to access (includes virtual folders like the
				#Transcode# folder). Note: this is a PS3 limitation.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Playback of video file stops at end of file and does not
			continue with next video file.</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution:</strong> PlayStation 3 XMB: Settings - Video
				Settings - Sequential Playback. Set the PS3 system to sequentially
				play multiple videos that are saved on the hard disk or storage
				media. See <a
					href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/bdsettings.html#3616">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/bdsettings.html#3616</a>.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>I receive two &quot;Media Server Error: A DLNA protocol error
			(2006) has occurred&quot; followed by &quot;There are no titles&quot;
			on the PS3 when trying to view the video folder that does contain
			valid video media.</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				<strong>Cause:</strong> There is a timing bug with PMS (as of the
				latest PMS beta 356 version) where the Media Library data is not
				being sent in a timely matter (ideally within the first 30 seconds,
				up to 1 minute) to the PS3. The results is the above error and the
				PS3 timing out. If you restart PMS or the PS3, the process will
				start all over again. This error can not be avoided by using the
				Magnifying Glass in the Shared folders tab and section. Previous
				Media Library processed data is always checked and re-checked,
				making it impossible to be avoided.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Solution 1:</strong> For unattended results; reduce the
				amount of files contained in the shared directory. You will need to
				find your own balance between your processor speed, the amount of
				files contained in the shared directory and the timeout of the PS3.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution 2:</strong> For attended results; after entering
				the Video PMS directory on the PS3, exit up one level. On the PMS
				installed machine, watch and wait for the JavaW.exe process to
				finish (measure the length of time between entering the directory
				and JavaW.exe finishing, you will need this information for later).
				Re-enter the Video PMS directory and shortly the names will now
				begin to be displayed regardless of the amount of files. Later, when
				this happens again, like before go up one level, but you will now
				know how long to wait before re-entering the PS3's Video PMS
				directory.

		<dt>How do I play DTS Music with PS3 fw 3.0?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Music settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Output Frequency: 44.1/88.2/176.4 kHz</li>
				<li>Bitmapping: Off or Type2</li>
				<li>Dynamic Normalizer: Off</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sound settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Audio Output Settings: untick Linear PCM 2 Ch. 88.2 and
					176.4 kHz</li>
				<li>Audio Multi-Output: Off</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Audio volume on PS3 has to be in the middle = Normal.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>How do I change settings when PMS is running as a service?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>You cannot change settings when PMS is running as a service.
				So you will have to stop the service and start the program to change
				settings as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stop the PMS service.</li>
				<li>Start PMS manually.</li>
				<li>Change the desired settings in the PMS interface and press
					the Save button.</li>
				<li>Quit PMS.</li>
				<li>Start the PMS service. Make sure that service is running
					with the same user account you are currently logged in.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>

		<dt>I receive errors or frozen playback when trying to Fast
			Forward, Rewind, or &quot;Scene Search&quot; through a video.</dt>
		<dd>
			This is to be expected on slower LAN connections or for any media
			that is being transcoded or remuxed. Use the PS3's "Go To" feature
			instead: <a
				href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/panel.html#9">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/panel.html#9</a>
		</dd>

		<dt>Why are the native subtitles missing for the non-native parts
			of a native audio movie?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Play the movie with the <a
					href=http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">UND
					language subtitles</a>, either directly from the #Transcode# folder or
				add UND to the "subtitle priority" setting under the MEncoder
				settings.
			</p>

			<p>If there is no UND language subtitle track, you'll have to
				either:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Manually select the proper language subtitle track from the
					#Transcode# folder.</li>
				<li>Edit the subtitle tracks in the file (change language code,
					remove other tracks, reorder, etc.). Note: this is not available
					through PMS.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>

		<dt>Is there a list of supported media renderers (streaming
			clients) for PS3 Media Server?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>At the moment the PS3, Xbox 360, and Philips (networked) TVs
				are well supported. There is experimental support for Sony Bravia
				and Samsung Wiselink TVs, XBMC (e.g. on Xbox), PopcornHour,
				FreeboxHD, and Realtek chip based media renderers. Other media
				renderers may work. You have to create a conf-file in renderers
				subdirectory of PMS installation directory.</p>

			<p>If you need assistance getting a new renderer working you
				should do the following:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>Download and install Intel UPnP tools: <a
						href="http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/isn/downloads/zips/IntelToolsForUPnPTechnology_v2.zip">http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/isn/downloads/zips/IntelToolsForUPnPTechnology_v2.zip</a>
					</li>
					<li>Run Device Spy</li>
					<li>Expand: Device name &gt; ...ConnectionManager...</li>
					<li>Doubleclick GetProtocolInfo</li>
					<li>Click Invoke</li>
					<li>copy Sink response and post to <a
						href="http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=15">http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=15</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You may also need to provide the Get Device XML (right click
					on device)</p>
			</blockquote>

		</dd>

		<dt>I want to run more than one PMS instance in my home network
			and identify them easily.</dt>
		<dd>There is no option to rename PMS in the interface. One has to
			change sourcecode and compile PMS in order to get a renamed version
			of it.</dd>

		<dt>I installed PMS, started it and PMS found PS3 immediately.
			Next time I started PMS and PS3 could not be found.</dt>
		<dd>
			PMS is programmed in Java. Sometimes the Java Runtime environment
			(JRE) does not shut down all Java processes properly after stopping
			PMS. If this happens stop all other Java based applications, start
			Windows task manager and kill all javaw.exe processes. After that
			start PMS once again and PS3 will be found. If that happens regularly
			update to the <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">latest
				version of Java</a>.
		</dd>

		<dt>How do I manually set up the Windows firewall</dt>
		<dd>
			PMS needs incoming port 5001 TCP/UDP to run properly. Instead of that
			you can also set up a firewall exception for the Java program
			"javaw.exe" (JRE/JDK) and "wrapper.exe" if PMS is running as a
			service. Windows firewall settings can be changed by GUI or command
			line. For detailed commandline instructions see <a
				href="http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;start=30#p18802">http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;start=30#p18802</a>.

		<dt>I enabled and scanned the media library on Windows 7, but I
			cannot use it on the XMB?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution 1:</strong> Start PMS as Administrator or change
				properties of pms.exe to run as Administrator
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Solution 2:</strong> Change NTFS permissions on folder
				C:\Program Files (x86)\PS3 Media Server\database\. To do this, start
				a commandline as Administrator.

			<p>After that the PMS startup and loading of the media database
				is fine.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Data corrupted at playback of CD / DVD ISOs or rips</dt>
		<dd>If you have problems with CD/DVD ISOs or rips you probably
			use a later version of the MPlayer tool. Streaming will encounter a
			timeout during building of the MPlayer font cache. You can create the
			font cache manually by playing a video directly without usage of PMS.
			In order to do that drag and drop a video file to MPlayer.exe
			(located in win32 subdirectory). Restart PMS after doing that.</dd>

		<dt>Streaming SiriusXM</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Requirements of course PS3, PS3 Media Server, Windows, LAN and
				SiriusXMStreamer. (<a href="http://www.permanence.com/sirius/">http://www.permanence.com/sirius/</a>)
			</p>
			<p>Once SiriusXMStreamer is set up, run the program and go to
				"Configuration". Enter your account info for either Siriux/XM (or
				both). Under "Default Stream Format", set it to "HTTP - M3U".
				"SiriusXMStreamer Server" is already prefilled so leave it alone.
				You will notice "TVersity Media Server", but leave that alone since
				that is not what you are using. Apply the settings and start the
				Server. Now you will need to make two entries in the "WEB.CONF" file
				of PMS. Below is an example:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>#audio podcasts
audiofeed.Web,Podcasts=http://podcasts.engadget.com/rss.xml
audiofeed.Web,Sirius=http://192.168.1.101:51710/sirius/feed?category=&amp;genre=&amp;format=m3u
audiofeed.Web,XM=http://192.168.1.101:51710/xm/feed?category=&amp;genre=&amp;format=m3u</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The IP address will be different depending on how your LAN is
				configured.</p>
			<p>To get the correct addresses for your feeds you can either
				just substitute the static IP of your PC running PS3 Media Server or
				go to SiriusXMStreamer and click on the "Sirius Channels" and "XM
				Channels", select "Feeds" then directly to the right using the drop
				down arrow, choose "Copy URL M3U" and paste the info into your
				"WEB.CONF.</p>
			<p>Restart the PS3 Media Server and both feeds should appear
				under "WEB - Sirius / XM". Somehow the feed shows a total run time
				of 1:45:32. When it reaches this time lapse, it will automatically
				move to the next feed.</p>

		</dd>

		<dt>Sometimes Java is causing trouble</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or management of memory for
				JRE is causing trouble in some systems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>High memory usage</li>
				<li>Settings are not saved after pressing the save button</li>
				<li>Java 6 update 18 is reported very often to cause problems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may change memory usage in "pms.bat" (Windows) or "pms.sh"
				(Linux). Open file named before with text editor and change value
				for memory "-Xmx768M" (standard is 768M = 768 Megabyte), save file
				and start PMS by using the file.</p>
			<p>Have a look at hanging Java processes ("javaw.exe"). Maybe you
				have to kill not responding Java processes or restart your computer.</p>
			<p>Also have a look at the value for transcode buffer. If it is
				very high (e.g. 600 MB) you only have 168MB left for PMS itself and
				its database. You may have to increase the -Xmx value. This is also
				valid if you use plugins like PS3radio which load a lot of radio
				stations in web.conf. Enabling iTunes in PMS may also cause this
				problem.</p>
